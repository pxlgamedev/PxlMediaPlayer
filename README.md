# Pxl Media Player

ASCII Music and Video Player

A simple interface for Python-VLC using BearLibTerminal to create the ultimate retro media player.

* Can play any media VLC can play (64 bit VLC must be installed)
* Play / Pause / Stop / Mute / Skip / Volume / Pan controls
* Configurable Playlist
* Simple to navigate interface
* Themeable

Apart from it's retro looks, PxL Media PLayer has a couple unique features:

# Media Playback Memory and Watched List

Add a directory to the main.ini file's whitelist and any file played from that directory (or sub directories) will store it's exact stop point for future viewing. Playing again, at any time in the future, will resume from that exact moment. The file browser also color codes entries based on how far you've watched them. Finished titles will be greyed out until restarted. This makes it a breeze to keep track of where you were in a specific series or which movies in a folder have been watched. A must have feature that is sorely lacking from even the most feature complete media programs.

# Purely Functional Browser

While it may not sound like a feature to some, the browser is primarily designed to access files directly on the hard drive, it does not have any tagging or sorting capabilities. The interface is designed for hyper organized individuals who keep their media sorted and labeled exactly how they want it on the hard drive and don't need extreniuous sorting methods to disrupt it.

# Optional Global Hotkeys

Not the most unique feature on the list, but one that is sorely lacking in many other programs. All hotkeys can be configured and toggled on or off with a single master hotkey (default ctrl+shit+h).

The primary purpose for releasing this program is as a tutorial for User Interface concepts relating to terminal based programs.
Program is provided AS IS. Use at your own risk and all that Jazz.
